## Prerequisites

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or local development and production machine**. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
Node.js. That's all you need.

```sh
node -v // v10.16.3
```

## Getting Started

### Running Development Server

#### npm

Run webpack dev server

```sh
npm install // Installing dependencied with node js package manager
npm start // Refer to react-scripts(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to learn more about this.
// Follow the instructions on terminal
```

#### yarn

Run server

```sh
yarn // Installing dependencied with node js package manager
yarn start // Refer to react-scripts(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to learn more about this.
// Follow the instructions on terminal
```

### Available Scripts

#### Storybook

```sh
yarn storybook
```

![cli](docs/storybook_cli.png)
![gui](docs/storybook.png)

#### Generate Component

**Using React hook, this script is no longer used.**

```sh
yarn generate [% component_architecture %] [% component_name %] "[% options %]"
```
* component_architecture :  One of [atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages]
* component_name : Captitalized first character is recommended (ex: HomePage)
* options (optional) : Combination of characters (r : react component, s : styled component, y : storybook, c : redux container) or '*' for all.
	Options must be captured inside quotes (" or ').
	Default option is "rsy"

#### Post Build

```sh
yarn postbuild
```

Helper script, making Front-end deployment graceful.

Automatically triggered after build command finishes.

#### Pre-Commit

```sh
yarn precommit
```

Lint and rewrite staged files.

Automatically triggered before commit.

### Get Ready for Production

#### npm

Build static files with webpack

```sh
npm install // Installing dependencied with node js package manager
npm run build  // Refer to react-scripts(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to learn more about this.
server -s deploy // or serve static files located in /deploy with whatever you like!
// I recommend you to set up production server with nginx. Please refer to [Deployment](#deployment) section for more.
```

#### yarn

Build static files with webpack

```sh
yarn // Installing dependencied with node js package manager
yarn build  // Refer to react-scripts(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) to learn more about this.
server -s deploy // or serve static files located in /deploy with whatever you like!
// I recommend you to set up production server with nginx. Please refer to [Deployment](#deployment) section for more.
```

## Proxy API Requests

Using http-proxy-middleware, all requests are proxied to localhost:6001 on which our API server is located.

## Authentication

All requests sent from client are intercepted by an axios instance located in [axios.js](src/lib/axios.js).

Axios request interceptor attaches authentication token into request header.

## Built with

* [Atomic Web Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
* [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) - Easy set up for react project
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - In-memory data structure store.

## Deployment

First, build static files with webpack regarding to [Get Ready for Production](#get-ready-for-production)
And then follow [zabo-server-nodejs deployment guide-line](https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/zabo-server-nodejs/tree/develop#running-production-server)

## Commit Message Guidelines

I referred [Google's Angular JS's contributor's commit message guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines) to format commit messages. This leads to more **unified** and **readable messages** helping further history lookups and even CI integrations.

By the way, this repository's commit messages format is not exactly same as the one suggested above.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/sparcs-kaist/zabo-server-nodejs/commits/master))

```
docs(README): update README adding instruction on how to start docker on EC2
```
```
build(babel): Add babel preset-env

Add @babel/core, @babel/preset-env and register with @babel/register.
Entry point of the application is set to be bin/www_es6.js
Refer to the package.json file to fidn out more.
```

### Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type
Should be one of the following:

* **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
* **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* **misc**: Adding miscellaneous items

### Scope
There's no specific recommendations for naming scope yet.
Feel free to write your own scopes.

### Subject
The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

* use the **imperative, present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* **do capitalize** the first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
If the commit derives changes from previous behavior, the body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
